# Eye Movement
This exercize was exciting, it allowed me to learn how to have the curser move the character on the screen (the eyeball). This was a crucial item to learn as it is used in many websites. I hope to be able to enhance this project by adding more features to the page, such as a noise when the eyeball moves.
